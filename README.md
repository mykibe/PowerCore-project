## ðŸŽ¨ Color System

Our color palette is designed for high contrast, visual energy, and readability:

| Color      | Usage                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Dark Blue  | buttons                 |
| Neon Green | Cards, accents and theme |
| White      | Text and background     |

**Rationale:**
The white background provides a solid, professional base that makes the site bright. Neon green serves as an energetic highlight to draw attention to important elements like buttons or active states. White ensures content remains readable and clean.

## ðŸ“± Breakpoint Logic

| Breakpoint | Width    | Layout Behavior                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SM         | < 640px  | Single-column layout                 |
| MD         | â‰¥ 640px  | Switches to a 2-column grid          |
| LG         | â‰¥ 1024px | Expands to 3-column grid (if needed) |

This ensures usability across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Divergence from Mockup

While the core layout and structure follow the original mockup, several creative choices were made:
* **Color Shift:** Replaced the mockup's neutral tones with a more vibrant and branded palette (dark blue & neon green).
* **Microinteractions:** Added hover effects and transitions on buttons and links to improve UX.
* **Typography Tuning:** Slight adjustments to font sizes and weights for better readability and hierarchy.
* **Dynamic Grid Behavior:** Implemented smoother column transitions at breakpoints for a more fluid responsive feel.
